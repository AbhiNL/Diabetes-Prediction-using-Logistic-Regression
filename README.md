Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can help manage the condition and prevent complications. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the risk of diabetes in patients based on certain features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, etc. In this project, we will use logistic regression to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on certain features.
